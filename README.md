# WebScrapingToDataframe
Python script for scraping project descriptions from Innovation Norway website.<br>
Project descriptions are in Norwegian.<br>
Results are saved as csv file 'description_.csv'.
<br>
Jupyter notebook: reads csv file and cleans the description columns.<br>
Concatenates the columns into one text per project.<br>
Creates a clean dataframe with result.<br>
Number of rows: 149.<br>
<br>
We would like to be able to search through the projects by theme for example 'havvind', 'helse', 'bistand', 'afrika', etc.<br>
The projects should be tagged automatically.<br>
<br>
Also we would like to be able to find projects which are similar to a selected one for instance.<br>
